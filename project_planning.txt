********************************
NOTES

The loader is now done. I added digit specific functionality

To load into a file:

from loader import Loader

load = Loader()
load.load_testing()
  or
load.load_training()

if you want to only do some digits

load = Loader()
load.load_testing(digits = [2,3,4])
  or
load.load_training(digits = [2])
(digits were chosen arbitrarily, do an array containing 0-9, or just one digit)


trying this

from pylab import *
from numpy import *
from loader import Loader
load = Loader("testing")
images, labels = load.load_dataset([2])
imshow(images.mean(axis=0), cmap=cm.gray)
show()


(Pdb) plt.pyplot.imshow(centroids[6].reshape(28, 28))
<matplotlib.image.AxesImage object at 0xaf0aee8c>
(Pdb) plt.pyplot.show()
