# CS51-final-project

To run the code:

Make sure you are running on Python 2.7

Dependencies:
  matplotlib
  numpy
  scipy

Follow the command line prompts:
  We allow you to run two different algorithms: kmeans and knn
  For kmeans:
   type "-m" or "--kmeans"
   to specify a k-value type: "-mk" or "--kmeansk" followed by 10, 15 or 20
  For knn:
    type "-n" or "--knn"
    to specify a k-value type: "-mk" or "--kmeansk" followed by the desired k

  If you forget, just type -h for help!

If you want to look at some other cool things, read over to report. There we
  have some analysis of the dataset that you can look at or run, as well as
  some sample graphs. In code you will also find PCA. While we couldn't get
  it to handle the larger dataset, it is still cool to look at the code.

A final note: The testing sets are selected randomly--you may want to try running
a few times to see how the accuracies change with different trials
